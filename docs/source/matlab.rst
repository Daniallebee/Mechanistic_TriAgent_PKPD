Usage with MATLAB
==================

The Python Anesthesia Simulator (PAS) can also be used from MATLAB and Simulink. This is made possible by leveraging the MATLAB/python interface. The following sections explain how to set up your MATLAB and simulink environment to use PAS, and demonstrate how to use it in both an open-loop and a closed-loop simulation.
