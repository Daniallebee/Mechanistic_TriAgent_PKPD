Welcome to Python Anesthesia Simulator's documentation!
=======================================================

The Python Anesthesia Simulator (PAS) models the effect of drugs on physiological variables during total intravenous anesthesia. It is particularly dedicated to the control community, to be used as a benchmark for the design of multidrug controllers. The available drugs are **propofol**, **remifentanil**, **norepinephrine**, and **atracurium** the outputs are the Bispectral Index (**BIS**), tolerance to laryngoscopy (**TOL**), loss of consciousness (**LOC**), mean arterial pressure (**MAP**), cardiac output (**CO**), total peripheral resistence (**TPR**), stroke volume (**SV**), heart rate (**HR**) and train of four (**TOF**). PAS includes different well-known models along with their uncertainties to simulate inter-patient variability. Blood loss can also be simulated to assess the controller's performance in a shock scenario. Finally, PAS includes disturbance profiles calibrated on clinical data to facilitate the evaluation of the controller's performances in realistic condition.
